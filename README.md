# Autoencoder-With-MNIST
In this project, I will show how to use Autoencoder with CNN technique in MNIST dataset via Python.

## Brief of Autoencoder
This technique can be used in Fraud detection in bank business. 
Autoendcoder is consist of 2 parts: 1) Encoder = which is learning the representation of the data, generally known as "Latent space". 2) Decoder = which is reconstruction part, the famous application is "Generative model".

## Brief of MNIST dataset
The MNIST dataset is a popular dataset for benchmarking machine learning models, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits, along with their corresponding labels.

# Prerequire package
1) Numpy
2) Matplotlib
3) Tensorflow
